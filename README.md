Project Description:

We are developing a proximity-based notification and information distribution system tailored towards Marketing departments or businesses in need of advertising solutions. We will develop a mobile application (front-end) that retrieves beacon-specific information from our server (based on beacon-id). This allows us to push notifications or other relevant information to the user's device based on their proximity to any of the beacons. That fundamental process is the core function of our project. We will build additional features utilizing that function and expand the project and its offerings. This solution can replace currently expensive and cumbersome methods of advertising and content distribution. Beacon hardware is comparatively cheap and easy to install. Many available beacons on the market today are simply stickers that you can place anywhere you like. Installation/placement is incredibly simple (easy install, easy maintenance, easy management). Beacons utilize Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), also marketed as Bluetooth Smart. It is an improvement on Classic Bluetooth technology.
Not only is our product/solution cheaper than current offerings and current systems, it is also more efficient and better in terms of personalized advertising.
